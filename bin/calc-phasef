# calculates the phase oscillator frequency (f)
# to play wav file at normal speed, the oscillator's period (n sec) must satisfy this expression:
#
#   n : table_len / n = 1 : sample_rate
#
# this says that the phase oscillator progress `n` sec, the pointer in wave form progress `table_len / n`,
# and, to play wave form at normal speed, this ratio must be `1 : sample_rate`
# (if at twice of normal speed, the ratio should be `1 : 2 * sample_rate`)
# so the n is `table_len / (2 * sample_rate)`.
# frequency is n's reciprocal, thus f is `(2 * sample_rate) / table_len`.
